All rights reserved. All texts, images, graphics, sound files, video files and animation files as well as their arrangements are subject to copyright and other laws for the protection of intellectual property. They may not be copied for commercial purposes or for distribution, nor may they be modified and used on other websites. Some Daimler Buses GmbH internet pages also contain material that is subject to the copyright of those parties who have made such material available.\n\n#### Products & Prices\n\nAfter the editorial deadline for individual pages, there may have been changes to products (including changes in construct or shape, differences in colour) and services. The illustrations may show accessories, optional extras or other features which are not part of the standard specification or service scope. Colour deviations are due to technical reasons. Individual pages may also contain types and services that are not offered in individual countries. Statements about statutory, legal and tax regulations and effects are only valid for the Federal Republic of Germany. Unless otherwise stated in the sales or delivery conditions, the prices valid on the day of delivery apply. For our contractual partners, the prices are a non-binding recommended price. Please ask a branch or contractual partner for the latest status.\n\n#### Trademarks\n\nAll Daimler Truck AG trademarks mentioned on our internet pages are legally protected trademarks. This applies in particular to the model names as well as all logos and emblems of the company.\n\n#### Trademark protection notice\n\n![](/fileadmin/user_upload/global/logos/Markenschutzhinweis-MB-22x21.png) and Mercedes-Benz are trademarks of Mercedes-Benz Group AG.\n\n#### License rights\n\nWe would like to offer you an innovative and informative internet program. We therefore hope that you will be as enthusiastic as we are about this creative effort. Please understand, however, that Daimler Truck AG must protect its intellectual property, including their patents, trademarks and copyrights, and that these internet pages cannot grant any license rights to Daimler Truck AG’s intellectual property.\n\n#### Notes about forward-looking statements\n\nOur internet pages contain forward-looking statements about our current assessment of future events. Words such as “aim”, “ambition”, “anticipate”, “assume”, “believe”, “estimate”, “expect”, “intend”, “can/could”, “plan”, “project”, “should” and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements.\n\nThese statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Some examples for this are:\n\n* an unfavourable development of the global economic situation, in particular a decline in demand in our most important sales markets,\n* a deterioration in our refinancing opportunities on the credit and financial markets,\n* unavoidable events of force majeure, such as natural disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political unrest, military conflicts, industrial accidents and their subsequent effects\n* changes in exchange rates, customs and foreign trade regulations,\n* a change in consumer behaviour,\n* a possible loss of acceptance of our products and services resulting in a deterioration in the enforcement of prices and in the utilization of production capacities,\n* price increases for fuels and raw materials,\n* interruptions in production due to material shortages, workforce strikes or supplier insolvencies,\n* a decline in resale prices of used vehicles,\n* the successful implementation of cost reduction and efficiency improvement measures,\n* the business prospects of the companies in which Daimler Truck AG holds significant interests,\n* the successful implementation of strategic cooperations and joint ventures,\n* the changes to laws, regulations and official guidelines, in particular as they relate to vehicle emissions, fuel consumption and safety,\n* as well as the completion of ongoing official or government-initiated investigations and the outcome of pending or threatened future legal proceedings and other risks and uncertainties, some of which are described in Daimler Truck AG’s current annual report or in the current interim report under the heading “Risk and Opportunity Report”.\n\nShould any of these uncertainties or imponderables materialize, or should the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, the actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements.\n\nWe neither intend nor assume any obligation to continually update forward-looking statements because they are based solely on the circumstances on the date of publication.\n\n#### Liability\n\nThe information and statements on these pages do not constitute any assurance or guarantee, whether expressed or implied. In particular, such information is not an implied assurance or guarantee in respect of quality, tradeability, suitability for specific purposes, or the non-infringement of laws and patents.\n\nIf advice or a recommendation is provided on our websites, Daimler Buses GmbH shall not be obliged to compensate any damages arising from compliance with the advice or recommendation, without prejudice to liability arising from a contractual relationship, a tort or any other legal provision.\n\nFurthermore, Daimler Buses GmbH excludes liability for slight negligent breaches of duty when downloading files made available by Daimler Buses GmbH on our internet pages, provided that these do not concern essential contractual obligations as well as life, health or body or claims under the Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz). The same applies to breaches of duty by our vicarious agents.\n\nOur internet pages also contain links to other pages on the internet. We would like to point out that we have no influence on the design and content of the linked pages. We can therefore assume no liability for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the information provided there. Against this background, we hereby distance ourselves from all content on these pages. This declaration applies to all links to external pages and their contents contained on our internet pages.\n\n#### Notice in accordance to Section 36 of the German Consumer Dispute Resolution Act (Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetz, VSBG)\n\nDaimler Buses GmbH will not participate in a dispute resolution process before a consumer arbitration board within the meaning of the German Consumer Dispute Resolution Act (Verbraucherstreitbeilegungsgesetz, VSBG) and is not obligated to do so.\n\n#### Rank order\n\nTerms of use for a digital offering take precedence over these legal notices.\n\nShare page\n\n\n\nService\n\n[00800 40204020](/de_en/mobility/24h-service/ \"00800 40204020\")\n[ServiceDirectory](/de_en/mobility/online-servicedirectory/ \"ServiceDirectory\")\n[Contact](/de_en/contact/ \"Contact\")\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\n* [ServiceDirectory](/de_en/mobility/online-servicedirectory/)\n* [ServiceCard](/de_en/mobility/servicecard/)\n* [ServiceContracts](/de_en/solutions/service-contracts/)\n* [Bus Training Platform](https://training.buses.daimlertruck.com/)\n* [Online-Shops](/de_en/shops/)\n* [Data confirmation](/de_en/support/service-information/data-confirmation/)\n\nSERVICE FOR BUSES AND COACHES\nOF THE BRANDS\n\n![](/fileadmin/user_upload/global/logos/MB-Logo.png)\n\n![](/fileadmin/user_upload/global/logos/Setra_Logo.png)\n\n[Supplier](/de_en/supplier/)\n[Privacy statement](/de_en/privacy-statement/)\n[Privacy Statement Website](/de_en/privacy-statement-website/)\n[Data protection information for customers and business partners](/de_en/data-protection-information-for-customers-and-business-partners/)\n[Our whistleblower system](/de_en/our-whistleblower-system/)\n[Legal notices](/de_en/legal-notices/)\n[Open Source](https://www.omniplus.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Headquarter/PDF/Open_Source/OP-FOSS-License2023-A5_290623.pdf)\n[Standardised navigation](/de_en/support/service-information/standardised-navigation/)\n[About OMNIplus](/de_en/about-omniplus/)\n[Sitemap](/de_en/sitemap/)\n\n© 2025 Daimler Buses GmbH.
